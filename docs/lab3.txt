=== Phenomena ===

= Tense/aspect =

Tense is not grammaticalised in Abui, although there are adverbs indicating time.

Aspect is marked with a number of suffixes.
Using an aspect marker is optional, for example:

#19 No aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
na lol
1SG walk
'I walk'

If an aspect marker does appear, it must be a suffix, not a prefix:

#20 Perfective
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
na lol-i
1SG walk-PFV
'I have walked'

#20.1 Ungrammatical order of aspect marker and verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
na i-lol
1SG PFV-walk
'I have walked'

Multiple aspect markers can co-occur.
Kratochvil (2007) claims that up to three markers can occur together,
although there are constraints on the order of the markers,
and which markers can co-occur.
In our testsuite, we have documented the orders for three of these markers --
perfective '-i', durative '-a', and perfect '-u'.
Of the six possible combinations of two of these,
only two combinations are attested.
One grammatical and one ungrammatical example are given here:

#29 Grammatical combination (PRF-PFV)
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
na lol-u-i
1SG walk-PRF-PFV
'I walked'

#30 Ungrammatical combination (PFV-PRF)
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
na lol-i-u
1SG walk-PFV-PRF
'I walked'


= Negation =

Negation is marked with the particle "naha",
which must appear immediately after the verb:

#35 Negation after verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
na lol naha
1SG walk NEG
'I do not walk'

#36 Ungrammatical negation before verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
na naha lol
1SG NEG walk
'I do not walk'

#37 Ungrammatical negation before verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
naha na lol
NEG 1SG walk
'I do not walk'


= Valence changing rules =

The grammar does not document any valence changing rules.
Several verbs are given which can appear with more than argument structure,
but there is no indication that one structure is the `basic' one.
There are no additional morphemes, other than agreement markers.


= Possessives =

Abui has two sets of prefixes which indicate possessives.
One set of prefixes are used for 'alienable' nouns and one set for 'inalienable' nouns,
but in both cases, the possessive marker must appear immediately before the possessed noun.
For example, a different prefix is used for "my house" and "my nose":

#38 1SG
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss}
ne-fala foka
1SG.AL-house be.big
'My house is big'

#39 Ungrammatical 1SG after noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
fala-ne foka
house-1SG.AL be.big
'My house is big'

#40 Ungrammatical inalienable 1SG with alienable noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
na-fala foka
1SG.INAL-house be.big
'My house is big'

#53 1SG
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss}
na-min foka
1SG.INAL-nose be.big
'My nose is big'

#54 Ungrammatical 1SG after noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
min-na foka
nose-1SG.INAL be.big
'My nose is big'

#55 Ungrammatical alienable 1SG with inalienable noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
ne-min foka
1SG.AL-nose be.big
'My nose is big'

In addition, 'inalienable' nouns may not appear without a possessor:

#52 Ungrammatical inalienable noun without possession
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
min foka
nose be.big
'The nose is big'

There is a strong semantic association with the two sets of nouns,
since "inalienable" nouns include many body parts.
However, some body parts are "alienable",
and "enemy" is also an "inalienable" noun.

For third person possessors, a possessor noun may optionally appear before the prefix:

#48 3.II with noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss}
ya he-fala foka
mother 3.II.AL-house be.big
'Mother's house is big'

#49 Ungrammatical 3.II with possessor noun after possessed noun
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}
he-fala ya foka
3.II.AL-house mother be.big
'Mother's house is big'


= Agreement =

The same set of prefixes used for possessives are also used for "undergoer" agreement.
Kratochvil does not use the term "object", because some transitive verbs occur with two undergoer arguments.
Undergoer arguments stand in contrast to agent arguments.
What we analysed in lab 2 as pronouns are perhaps better described as agent markers,
as they can co-occur with agent NPs, appearing immediately after the NP.
Undergoer agreement markers appear immediately before the verb.

#76 Grammatical (bound marker agrees with object in terms of person)
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
maama moku ha-fanga
father child 3II.PAT-say
'Father orders the child'

#77 Ungrammatical (bound marker does not agree with object in terms of person)
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
maama moku na-fanga
father child 1SG.PAT-say
'Father orders the child'

#78 Grammatical (bound marker expresses object in terms of person)
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
maama na-fanga
father 1SG.PAT-say
'Father orders me'

There are three kinds of undergoer agreement markers:
"locative" (identical in form to the alienable possessive markers)
"patient" (identical in form to the inalienable possessive markers)
"recipient" (a distinct set of markers for the verbal domain)

Different contructions require different agreement markers.
Verbs may appear in multiple constructions,
and the set of verbs which can appear in construction
seems at least partly cluster along semantic lines.

Some constructions allow two agreement markers.
Several combinations of agreement markers are possible, but not all.
One example:

#81 Grammatical (U_REL-U_LOC transitive construction)
Source: a:249
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
o-ne-beei
2SG.REC-1SG.LOC-be.angry
'You feel angry with me'


= Argument optionality =

The grammar does not explicitly say whether arguments are optional or not.
There is at least one example in the grammar that seems to show an optional agent,
although this has been taken from  a longer text, where an agent may be present:

de-   kanai         do  baab   -i   ba  nee
3I.AL-canari.nut PRX strike.CPL-PFV LNK eat
‘he was crushing the canari nuts for himself and ate (them)’

Kratochvil also says:
``In questions and imperative constructions, A arguments (NP/PRO_A) may be omitted.''
This might suggest that they may not be omitted in other contexts.


=== Revised choices ===

We have added a lexical type for each pronoun/agent marker,
rather than using the same type for all of them.


=== New choices ===

= Tense/aspect =

We added a type for each kind of aspect.
We added a suffix position class for the aspect markers,
and a lexical rule type and instance for each marker.
This will currently undergenerate,
but a more careful analysis would be needed
to correctly model the full set of allowable combinations.

= Negation =

We added the negation particle as an adverb appearing after the VP.
Kratochvil claims that only one negation particle can appear in serial verb constructions,
which suggests that negation must be at the clause level rather than at the lexical level.
There are also some particles which can appear after negation.
These phenomena were out of the scope of this lab,
but they suggest that attaching to the VP is the right analysis.

= Agreement =

We added a prefix position class for the undergoer agreement markers.
We added a lexical rule type and instance for each marker.
This will currently undergenerate,
but a more careful analysis would be needed
to correctly model the full set of allowable combinations.
Labelling a clause as "transitive" is not specific enough for Abui.

= Argument optionality =

At present, the data does not seem completely clear.
We are tentatively going with the analysis that
object NPs can be dropped only if agreement is present,
and subject NPs cannot be dropped.

= Possessives =

This is not covered in the customisation system.

Lab #8 Write-Up

This write-up documents the work done for Lab #8. It includes working on
phenomenon found in one sentence from the test corpus as well as the first
... of machine translation, including variable property mapping for unspecified
aspect.

Variable Property Mapping and First MT
--------------------------------------

The first time that we tried to translate the sentence "Dogs sleep" from
English to Abui, the generator output was unconstrained for aspect. As a
result, the generator produced the correct translation `kaai taa' (lit. "dog
sleep") as well as translations that included every aspect marker on the verb
`taa` (e.g., `kaai taa-i`, `kaai taa-o`, etc.).

In order to remedy this, we added two changes: one to abui.tdl and the other
to semi.vpm.

In abui.tdl, we included the following line to declare a "no-aspect" aspect:

no-aspect := aspect.

In semi.vpm, we replaced the following line under "E.ASPECT : E.ASPECT"

  * <> *

with the following line

  * >> no-aspect
  no-aspect << [e]

.

After saving the changes, reloading the grammar, and attempting to translate
the English sentence "Dogs sleep" again, the generator correctly produced
the only translation `kaai taa`.

In addition, the internal MRS of the translation `kaai taa` and the internal
MRS of the correct parse of `kaai taa` from the target LKB are the same,
indicating that semantics of the translation is correct.*

* We are getting overgeneration of the phrase `kaai taa` in the target LKB.
Namely, the readings of the two parses being produced by the target LKB are
listed below:

(1) There exists dogs and the dogs sleep.
(2) There exists dogs and (something; may or may not be the dogs) sleep(s).

(1) is the expected parse. The reason for (2) is that Abui is a zero-copula
language and has argument drop. For the time being, we are disregarding this
because we have not been able to devise a solution for the issue.

Lab 7 Write-Up

In our write-up, we discuss a few phenomena that we covered in this week's lab,
including negation, those found in a test sentence from our corpus, and
wh-questions.

--------
Negation
--------

In Abui, negation is indicated by the word `naha`, which occurs after a verb.

For example:

#35 Negation after verb
Source: author
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
na lol naha
1SG walk NEG
'I do not walk'

The following is an example of an ungrammatical usage of `naha`, as it comes
before the verb as well as the subject:

#37 Ungrammatical negation before verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
naha na lol
NEG 1SG walk
'I do not walk'

In lexicon.tdl, we have included the following lexical entry for `naha`:

naha := neg-adv-lex &
  [ STEM < "naha" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "neg_rel" ].

The following lexical rule, which can be found in abui.tdl, takes care of
negative adverbs:

neg-adv-lex := basic-scopal-adverb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                             COMPS < >,
                             SUBJ < > ],
                       POSTHEAD +,
                       HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
                                                VAL [ SUBJ cons,
                                                      COMPS null ] ] ] > ] ].

The resource grammar we are using also lists `naha` to have the gloss "not.be".
However, we are ignoring the polysemy of `naha` for the time being.

---------------------------------
One sentence from the test corpus
---------------------------------

We are using the following sentence from the test corpus:

#127 Grammatical (one sentence from the test corpus)
Corpus: a:422
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {}
'e-sora 'e-sapada do lakang masena do
2SG.AL-sword 2SG.AL-machete PRX really be.nice PRX
'your swords and machetes are really nice!'

There are two phenomena that the sentence contains that our grammar does not
yet cover: (1) degree specifiers of adjectives, to account for the usage of
`lakang` ("really") and (2) anaphoric demonstratives, which can be modeled as
sentential adverbs, to account for the usage of the second `do` (PRX).

There is also the addition that `'e` is a phonologically reduced form of the
second person singular alienable object marker `he`. Since phonological
reduction is out of the scope of our assignment, we will be treating `'e` as
`he` for the time being.

To account for (1), we changed the adverb lexical rule so that it can modify
both verbs and adjectives:

adv-lex := basic-int-adverb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ POSTHEAD -,
                       HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +vj ] >,
                       VAL [ COMPS < >,
                             SUBJ < >,
                             SPR < >,
			     SPEC < > ] ] ].

Unfortunately, (2) has not been successfully implemented.

In addition, we added lexical entries for words that did not exist in our
lexicon.tdl file previously:

sora := alienable-noun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "sora" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_sword_n_rel" ].

sapada := alienable-noun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "sapada" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_machete_n_rel" ].

lakang := adv-lex &
  [ STEM < "lakang" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_really_a_rel" ].

masena := adj-adj-lex &
  [ STEM < "masena" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_nice_a_rel" ].

------------
Wh-questions
------------

Abui is a wh-in-situ language. In our test suite, we have covered two: `nala`
("what") and `maa` ("who"). The following examples illustrate their
usage in Abui:

#89 Grammatical (wh question using what; wh-in-situ; subject)
Source: a:129
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
nala e-l-takei?
what 2SG.LOC-give-bite
'What bit you?'

#90 Grammatical (wh question using who; wh-in-situ; subject)
Source: a:129
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
maa e-l-takei?
who 2SG.LOC-give-bite
'Who bit you?'

#93 Grammatical (wh question using what; wh-in-situ; object; transitive verb)
Source: a:128
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
a nala ong?
2SG what make
'What are you doing/making?'

In the abui.tdl file, we added the following lexical rule that was provided in
the Lab 7 prompt; however, we changed "PER" to "PERNUM", as Abui does not
distinguish between 3rd person singular and 3rd person plural:

wh-pronoun-noun-lex := norm-hook-lex-item & basic-icons-lex-item & 
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun,
			   VAL [ SPR < >,
				 SUBJ < >,
				 COMPS < >,
				 SPEC < > ] ],
		     CONT [ HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3rd,
	                    RELS <! [ LBL #larg,
				       ARG0 #ind & ref-ind ],
				  [ PRED "wh_q_rel",
				    ARG0 #ind,
				    RSTR #harg ] !>,
			    HCONS <! [ HARG #harg,
				        LARG #larg ] !> ] ],
	     NON-LOCAL.QUE <! #ind !> ] ].

In addition, in the lexicon.tdl file, we added the two lexical entries,
corresponding to the words for "what" and "who" in Abui:

nala := wh-pronoun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "nala" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_thing_n_rel" ].

maa := wh-pronoun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "maa" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_person_n_rel" ].

Metrics

The generation of Lab 6 is 90%, and its overgeneration is 45.3%. Similarly,
the overgeneration of Lab 7 is 90%, and its overgeneration is 45.3%. Comparing
the two, they are exactly the same.
